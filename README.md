Nostalgia of the Blinking Eye

Description:
This project is a visually dynamic webpage that transitions from a poetic text sequence into an animated realistic blinking eye with a tear effect. The background changes from a blue-to-turquoise gradient to dark burgundy-to-black gradient to enhance the emotional impact of the transformation.

Features:
- Displays a poetic passage word-by-word.
- Transforms into a polaroid-style frame containing a blinking eye.
- Background shifts to a darker gradient when the eye appears.
- Includes a tear animation for added emotional depth.
- A light effect spans the center of the screen for a cinematic touch.

Files:
- index.html – Main HTML file containing the animation logic.
- README.txt – This documentation file.

Usage:
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. Watch the text transition into the blinking eye animation.
3. The tear appears after a delay for dramatic effect.

Customization:
- Adjust background colors in the CSS under body { background: linear-gradient(...); }.
- Modify text by editing the words array in the JavaScript section.
- Change the eye or light effect styles in the CSS for different aesthetics.

Notes:
- Ensure you have an active internet connection if using external assets.
- The animation timing can be adjusted in the JavaScript.
